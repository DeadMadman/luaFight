# luaFight

## Description

We would like you to do a test to evaluate your skill level.
Our test is pretty straight forward and gives a lot of freedom to the programmer
to design it in their own way.

Description:
We would like you to do a playable “boss fight” with the game engine LÖVE
https://love2d.org.

The end result can be as small or ambitious as you like.

We will look at:
* Code structure. is the code readable, well formatted and bug free.
* Creativity, what did you choose to do with the assignment.
* Game feel, how well does the game control, attention to details, animation fluidity etc.

We won't focus on art, programmer art is welcome.
The test should be submitted to us by Friday the 3rd March to info@axolotgame.se
If you have any questions then please let me know!
